Miscellaneous
=============

Mailing list
------------

Join to `django-social-auth discussion list`_ and bring any questions or suggestions
that would improve this application. Convore_ discussion group is deprecated since
the service is going to be shut down on April 1st.


Sout users
----------

South_ users should add this rule to enable migrations::

    try:
        import south
        from south.modelsinspector import add_introspection_rules
        add_introspection_rules([], ["^social_auth\.fields\.JSONField"])
    except:
        pass


Custom User model
-----------------

If defining a custom user model, do not import ``social_auth`` from any
``models.py`` that would finally import from the ``models.py`` that defines
your ``User`` class or it will make your project fail with a recursive import
because ``social_auth`` uses ``get_model()`` to retrieve your User.


Third party backends
--------------------

There's an ongoing movement to create a list of third party backends on
djangopackages.com_, so, if somebody doesn't want it's backend in the
``contrib`` directory but still wants to share, just split it in a separated
package and link it there.


Python 2.7.2rev4, 2.7.3 and Facebook backend
-------------------------------------------

Seems that this bug described in StackOverflow_ hits users using
django-social-auth_ with Python versions 2.7.2rev4 and 2.7.3 (so far) and
Facebook backend. The bug report `#315`_ explains it a bit more and shows
a workaround fit avoid it.
