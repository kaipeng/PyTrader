Facebook
========

Facebook works similar to Twitter but it's simpler to setup and redirect URL
is passed as a parameter when issuing an authorization. Further documentation
at `Facebook development resources`_:

- Register a new application at `Facebook App Creation`_, and

- fill ``App Id`` and ``App Secret`` values in values::

      FACEBOOK_APP_ID
      FACEBOOK_API_SECRET

- Define ``FACEBOOK_EXTENDED_PERMISSIONS`` to get extra permissions from facebook.
  NOTE: to get users' email addresses, you must request the 'email' permission::

     FACEBOOK_EXTENDED_PERMISSIONS = ['email']

  Take into account that Facebook doesn't return user email by default, this
  setting is needed if email is required::

     FACEBOOK_EXTENDED_PERMISSIONS = ['email']

- Define ``FACEBOOK_PROFILE_EXTRA_PARAMS`` to pass extra parameters to
  https://graph.facebook.com/me when gathering the user profile data, like::

    FACEBOOK_PROFILE_EXTRA_PARAMS = {'locale': 'ru_RU'}

If you define a redirect URL in Facebook setup page, be sure to not define
http://127.0.0.1:8000 or http://localhost:8000 because it won't work when
testing. Instead I define http://myapp.com and setup a mapping on /etc/hosts
or use dnsmasq_.
